# ComposeDB Example App instructions

Due to the nature of the Ceramic Daemon certain files must be updated to work with your local machine. Please follow the following directions carefully to ensure functionality.

1. Run `npm install` to install the packages
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev` once. You may continue to use this command if you'd like however it will close all Ceramic connections at the first error. It is recommended that once your node is configured to index the required models that you run `npm run ceramic` & `npm run nextDev` separately to avoid this eager quitting.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
4. Enjoy this demo application!
